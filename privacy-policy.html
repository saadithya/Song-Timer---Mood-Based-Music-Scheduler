  <p>Thank you for using <strong>Song Timer - Mood Based Music Scheduler</strong> (“the Extension”).  
  Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use the Extension.</p>

  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <li>If you choose to export settings or backups, the data is only saved to your device via Chrome’s download feature.</li>
    <li>Because no external transmission occurs, your data remains secure on your device.</li>
